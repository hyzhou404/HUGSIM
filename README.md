# Installation

First, install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/):

``` bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

As the repository depends on some packages that can only be installed from source code, and rely on pytorch and cuda to compile, the installation of pixi environment is seperated as **two steps**:

1. Comment the packages below `# install from source code` in `pixi.toml`, then run `pixi install` to install the packages from pypi.
2. Uncomment the packages in the previous step, then run `pixi install` to install these packages from source code.
3. Install apex (required by InverseForm) by running `pixi run install-apex`

Change into the **pixi environment** by using the command `pixi shell`.

Or you can use `pixi run <command>` to run a command in the **pixi environment**.


# Data Preparation

Please refer to [Data Preparation Document](data/README.md)

You can download sample data from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hyzhou404/HUGSIM/tree/main/sample_data).

# Reconstruction

``` bash
seq=${seq_name}
input_path=${datadir}/${seq}
output_path=${modeldir}/${seq}
mkdir -p ${output_path}
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4 \
python -u train_ground.py --data_cfg ./configs/${dataset_name: [kitti360, waymo, nusc, pandaset]}.yaml \
        --source_path ${input_path} --model_path ${output_path}
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=4 \
python -u train.py --data_cfg ./configs/${dataset_name}.yaml \
        --source_path ${input_path} --model_path ${output_path}
```

# Scene Export

The reconstructed scene folders contain some information that won't be utilized during the simulation. The scenes are expected to be exported as a minimized format to facilitate easier sharing and simulation.
```bash
 python eval_render/export_scene.py --model_path ${recon_scene_path} --output_path ${export_path} --iteration 30000
``` 
We've made some changes in the capturing and reloading code. If you would like to convert scenes from previous version (before commit 1ca821a8) of our code, add `--ver0` in the above command. 

# Vehicles, Scenes and Scenarios

We have released all 3DRealCar files, along with the complete set of scenes and scenarios, at [release link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XDimLab/HUGSIM). 
We are also holding a competition at [RealADSim @ ICCV 2025](https://huggingface.co/spaces/XDimLab/ICCV2025-RealADSim-ClosedLoop), so some scenarios and scenarios are hosted privately. We welcome participants to join!

# Scenarios configuration with GUI

**Note that this GUI is only used for configuration scenarios, rather than simulation. The rendering quality in GUI is not the results during simulation**

First convert the vehicles and scenes to splat and semantic format.

``` bash
python eval_render/convert_vehicles.py --vehicle_path ${PATH_3DRealCar}
python eval_render/convert_scene.py --model_path ${PATH_Scene}
```

Then, you can run the GUI to configure the scenario. 
**nuscenes_camera.yaml** in gui/static/data provides a camera configuration template, you can modify it to fit your needs.

``` bash
cd gui
python app.py --scene ${PATH_Scene} --car_folder ${PATH_3DRealCar/converted}
```

You can configure the scenario with the GUI, and download the yaml file to use in simulation.

Here is a video for the GUI usage demonstration: [GUI Video](https://github.com/hyzhou404/HUGSIM/blob/main/assets/hugsim_gui.mp4)

# Simulation

**Before simulation, [UniAD_SIM](https://github.com/hyzhou404/UniAD_SIM), [VAD_SIM](https://github.com/hyzhou404/VAD_SIM) and [NAVSIM](https://github.com/hyzhou404/NAVSIM) client should be installed. The client environments are allowed to be separated from the HUGSIM environment.**

The dependencies for NAVSIM are already specified as the pixi environment file, so you don't need to manually install the dependencies.

In **closed_loop.py**, we automatically launch autonomous driving algorithms.

Paths in **configs/sim/\*\_base.yaml** should be updated as paths on your machine.

``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${sim_cuda} \
python closed_loop.py --scenario_path ./configs/benchmark/${dataset_name}/${scenario_name}.yaml \
            --base_path ./configs/sim/${dataset_name}_base.yaml \
            --camera_path ./configs/sim/${dataset_name}_camera.yaml \
            --kinematic_path ./configs/sim/kinematic.yaml \
            --ad ${method_name: [uniad, vad, ltf]} \
            --ad_cuda ${ad_cuda}
```

Run the following commands to execute.

```bash
sim_cuda=0
ad_cuda=1

# change this variable as the scenario path on your machine
scenario_dir=${SCENARIO_PATH} 

for cfg in ${scenario_dir}/*.yaml; do
    echo ${cfg}
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${sim_cuda} \
    python closed_loop.py --scenario_path ${cfg} \
                        --base_path ./configs/sim/nuscenes_base.yaml \
                        --camera_path ./configs/sim/nuscenes_camera.yaml \
                        --kinematic_path ./configs/sim/kinematic.yaml \
                        --ad uniad \
                        --ad_cuda ${ad_cuda}
done
```

In practice, you may encounter errors due to an incorrect environment, path, and etc. For debugging purposes, you can modify the last part of code as:
```python
# process = launch(ad_path, args.ad_cuda, output)
# try:
#     create_gym_env(cfg, output)
#     check_alive(process)
# except Exception as e:
#     print(e)
#     process.kill()

# For debug
create_gym_env(cfg, output)
```

# TODO list
- [x] Release sample data and results
- [x] Release unicycle model part
- [x] Release GUI
- [x] Release more scenarios
